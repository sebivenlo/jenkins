The practice of Continuous Integration (CI) has gained a large popularity and high importance over the last couple of years. Martin Fowler summarizes what CI is all about:

____
Continuous Integration is a software development practice where members of a team integrate their work frequently, usually each person integrates at least daily - leading to multiple integrations per day. Each integration is verified by an automated build (including test) to detect integration errors as quickly as possible.

During this workshop, a simple CI workflow will be created. We will be using link:https://jenkins.io[Jenkins] as the CI tool. After completing the workshop you will be able to perform the following tasks:

* Install and configure Jenkins plugins
* Create new Jenkins jobs (Git + Maven + JUnit)
* Automate all of the above using Docker

=== Prerequisites
You should be familiar with Maven as well as with Docker. Furthermore, you need a running installation of Docker on your machine. Have a look at the link:https://github.com/sebivenlo/dockerstart[dockerstart repository] for a guide on Docker.

=== Setup
To start with the exercises, clone the workshop repository:

[source,bash]
git clone https://github.com/sebivenlo/jenkins.git
git checkout workshop
git checkout -f step-0

In case you get stuck during the workshop, you can simply checkout the repository at a specific step using the following command:

[source,bash]
git checkout -f step-<x>

=== Docker Cheat Sheet
During the workshop, you will be using quite a few docker commands. We added a link:docker-cheat-sheet/docker-cheat-sheet.html[cheat sheet] containing all the commands that you might need during the workshop.
