=== Step 5 - Create Jenkins Job
After we have installed our Jenkins server, let's do something meaningful. Let's create a job for the link:https://github.com/sebivenlo/statemachines[statemachine] project.

Therefore, at the homescreen of the Jenkins site click on _New item_ and provide the job with a name like *sebivenlo-mavenstatestack*, choose _Freestyle project_ as project type and click on _Save_.

Now, Jenkins is asking us to configure the job in detail. First of all, we have to choose the right _Source Control Management_ system. Because the project is available on GitHub, Git is the right one. For the _Repository URL_ we set the link:https://github.com/sebivenlo/statemachines[URL] of the Project.

[source]
Repository URL = https://github.com/sebivenlo/statemachines/

Because the project is a public project, we don't need any credentials. So, we can skip it. The other settings in the SCM section can remain at their default values.

The last step for the configuration is to tell Jenkins how to build the project. Fortunately, since the project is a Maven project, we only have to tell Jenkins where the POM file is located and which goal should be executed.

Therefore, click _add build step_ and choose, _Invoke top-level Maven targets_. Now, choose the Maven version (Maven 3.3.3) which we configured in the previous step and set the maven goals to

[source,bash]
clean test

Afterwards, click on _Advanced_ and specify the location of the POM file which will be executed. This is the relative path in our repository.

[source]
mavenstatestack/pom.xml

Complete the configuration by clicking on save. So far, so good. Let's have a look whether our fellow students did a great job. If we can build and test the project without any issues, everything is fine :). For that, choose the job and click on the _Build Now_ button on the left-hand side. Now, there should be a new item at the _Build History_ list at the bottom. Click on it and check the status. You can have a look at the _Console Output_ as well. The result of the _Console Output_ should look something like this:

Well done, in this step we learned how we can configure a Jenkins job within the Jenkins environment as well as how we can build the job manually.
