=== Step 2 - Adding Jenkins plugins

Inside the `jenkins` directory create a file called `plugins.txt`. Give the file the following https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sebivenlo/jenkins/ab81d6138fa8ad643d749e8ef7c60fe9ea015485/jenkins/plugins.txt[contents]. This will provide Jenkins with the necessary plugins for this workshop.

Now in order to load these plugins, the `Dockerfile` needs to be changed. Insert the following two lines into the `Dockerfile`, right before the line where the Jenkins configuration file is being copied:
```
COPY plugins.txt /var/jenkins_home/plugins.txt
RUN /usr/local/bin/install-plugins.sh $(cat /var/jenkins_home/plugins.txt | tr '\r' '' | tr '\n' ' ')
```

Now once more verify that Jenkins is still working by executing `docker-compose up -d` and visit the URL.
