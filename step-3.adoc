=== Step 3 - Manual plugin installation

Access the Jenkins web-interface by going to `http://192.168.99.100:18080[http://<docker-machine ip>:18080]`. On the left-side pane click on *Manage Jenkins*. Then click on *Manage Plugins*. Next select the *Available* tab and then at the top-right enter `github` into the filter box. Finally check the *GitHub plugin*. Do the same for `github-api`, `git-client` and `git plugin`. After having checked these, at the bottom of the screen click on *Download now and install after restart*. After Jenkins has restarted the plugins should be installed.
