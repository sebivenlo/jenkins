=== Step 3 - Manual plugin installation

In this step we are going to use Jenkins' web interface to manually add some plugins.

So let's start by accessing the Jenkins web-interface by going to `http://docker:18080`. On the left-side pane click on *Manage Jenkins*. Then click on *Manage Plugins*.

Navigate to the *Available* tab and at the top-right enter `github` into the filter box. Finally check the *GitHub plugin*. Do the same for `github-api`, `git-client` and `git plugin`. 

After having checked these, at the bottom of the screen click on *Download now and install after restart*. After Jenkins has restarted the plugins should be installed.
