Of course, this was not the end of this matter. There are a lot of things to play with. Feel free to extend this workshop.
At the end, you find some suggestions. But for now, you are able to create a Jenkins server with the help of Docker. You are able to configure simple things manually as well as automatically.
And of course you got first insights into Continuous Integration (CI) and you further improved your knowledge about Docker.

=== Suggestions
* Add another service to the pipeline. In the link:https://github.com/sebivenlo/jenkins[main repository] there is already a sonar service configured.
It would be nice if e.g. a Widfly service will be added.
* Further configuration of the Jenkins server.
** User Roles
** Email notification on failed builds
** Support for Subversion
** CRON Jobs
* Automatic deployments to application server, Nexus etc.

...and much more.
